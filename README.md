# liri-node-app
#   This app is designed to be a written version of what the app Siri accomplishes.
# Obviously Siri's depth of capability is far more than we'll be tackling for this project.

# the user will type specific commands into the bash/terminal and the app will take those commands and call the information from one of the specific API's used.
#   the three API's used are Spotify, Bands in Town and OMDB.
#       Spotify will grab the artist(s), the song's name, a preview link of the song from Spotify and the album that the song is from.
##          spotify-this "name of song"
#       Bands in Town will find the name of the venue, venue location and the date of the Event.
##          concert-this "name of band"
#       The final API, OMDB, will output the title of the movie, year the movie came out, the IMDB Rating of the movie, Rotten Tomatoes rating of the movie, the country where the movie was produced, the language of the movie, the plot of the movie and the actors in the movie.
##          movie-this "name of movie"
# Finally the app will take in a specific command, "do-what-it-says," and the user will get a treat.
